A tool to execute perf on a set of given remote machines and to analyze the result.
Runs interactively, profiling happens while script is running

Installation:
 * setup a virtualenv if you don't want to install stuff globally with pip
 * make install

Usage:
 * make hosts=path_to_hosts run
 * run your benchmark and wait
 * Ctrl+C to stop profiling on the remote machines
 * make hosts=path_to_hosts get 
 * perf data is downloaded to local machine
 * make analyze
 * flame graphs are generated

This installs a customized version of parallel-ssh that sends the ctrl+c character to the remote machines, instead of killing them abruptly. This allows perf to clean up on the remote side.
